(conceptual) What are the advantages and disadvantages of breaking down the entire workflow on discrete steps of preparing -> backtesting -> identification -> prediction -> output? Could it be made differently?
- can test/upgrade each module separately and flexibly combine them

(hands-on) Can you execute the RAI Digital Twin through the CLI? Does the output matches the one that we've seen on the slides?
- yes, see html in folder. only did a limited run but it works

(hands-on) What happens if you use different CLI arguments?
For instance, what happens if extrapolation is done for 2 months rather than 2 weeks?
- extrapolation out in the future gets wild expecially for low CSI scenarios

Or if the past days to be downloaded are 3 days rather than 14 days?
- did not test but used downloaded data only

Any other relevant question!
