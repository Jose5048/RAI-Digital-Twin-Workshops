# Challenge 3: Ethical Hacking of the RAI Stability Coin -1

#### Introduction:

*****Challenge 3:***** How would you introduce events into the past and future? How should someone proceed to include shocks into the extrapolation phase?

We define below what we percieve as a serious challenge to the RAI stability coin emerging as *the universal or pivotal* **"stability  coin"** much alike the way Bitcoin has clearly emerged as the pivotal repository for "vaue".

In the  context proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller), the above issue is purely in the real of the Derivative, beyong being a pure PI controller alone. Conceptually, from a research point of view we would simulate RAI on a CEX to generate arbitage signals from it in the form of events or price shocks and evaluate the response time of the $RAI_{dex}$under various limiting conditions. This would give a clue to the vulnaerability of the $RAI$ Stability Coin for the issue cited below.

#### Background: 

The RAI stability coin is based on a stability mechanism drawn directly from engineering: the PID controller. While this approach has a lot going for it in the sense it reduces the governance surface, there are fundamental weaknesses inherent to such an approach which needs to be understood and addressed where ever possible:

a) These problems are inherent to  Blockchain and DEX which *[we highlighted in an earlier research, offering some tentative solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcD2YCdbUAg).* .

 b) A significant part of the problem we insist is related the direct [Noether like transposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxlHLqJ9I0A) *from physical systems to essentially socio-economic ones* which in some sense, is almost naively approached in this implementation. We have discussed this [in an earlier research] in a different context. ((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkN2_UYcHhs)).

### Weakness -1 : Vulnerability to  Frontrunning

It will be  possible to mimic RAI exactly and a far more responsive one on a CEX. And  will then be possible to arbitrage between the RAI on the DEX $RAI_{dex}$ and RAI on CEX $RAI_{cex}$. Very quickly a discernible correlation builds between CEX-RAI and DEX-RAI *but with an exploitable lag*, clearly obvious during market events.

#### Example: 
A distribution announcement (dividend, stock split equivalent) by an entity could swing the market at the first hint, in micro seconds in CEXs of any hue, but on a Blockchain based DEX it will be lagged and vulnerable to being front run. For RAI, what has to be watched out for are major policy or regulatory announcements which have an impact on the total market. 

#### Impact:
When the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGT) mimicked the National Stock Exchange of India's NIFTY Index, [over half the volume shifted to SGT](https://www.capitalmind.in/2018/04/the-battle-of-taxes-can-win/). *Similarly RAI volumes could shift to the mimicked one on CEX.*

### Weakness -2 : Vulnerability to AI based HFT Interventions

 By extending this concept, it may be possible to manipulate RAI on DEX itself through HFT trading. A series of infinitesimally small HFT transactions to skew RAI  prices and trade it to Mean Reversal. The current punishing of Moby Dicks may not work against HFT infinitesimally small costless, highly sophisticated, ill intentioned interventions.
 
 Whatever values of $K_p$, $K_i$ or $K_d$ which $RAI$ assumes to counteract a whale, the Algo AI Reinforcement Learning based systems can counteract these actions with a continuous flow of infinitesimally small transactions to skew RAI to some targeted level. It then used Mean Reversal Techniques to opportunistically drive the prices back to the market mean (the VWAP - Volume Weighted Average Price)
