# RAI-Digital-Twin-Workshops
Repo for the content and submissions on the RAI Digital Twin Workshops, scheduled for Nov 4th to 18th


- Challenges repo: RAI-Digital-Twin-Workshops at TokenEngineeringCommunity, on GitHub
https://github.com/TokenEngineeringCommunity/RAI-Digital-Twin-Workshops
- Each workshop will have an challenge submission folder (eg. intro_to_rai_challenges) where everyone is invited to add their contributions.
    - If the submission has multiple files, it is recommended that each one creates an subfolder on the submission folder, like `intro_to_rai_challenges/danlessa/`, and put their content inside it
- To submit, fork the repo, add the relevant commits on the fork, and send a Pull Request to the origin. Submissions are going to be accepted on all cases (*), and they're going to be reviewed for feedback, to be provided on a separate .md file.
    - (*): provided that it is not clearly spam
